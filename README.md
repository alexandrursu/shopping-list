# Shopping List:

You can access live [DEMO here](https://alexandrursu.github.io/shopping-list/):

# Assignment:
1-page of HTML / JS that performs the function of a shopping list that can be added to/removed from. Concise, clean, functional code with no external dependencies.

# Solution:
Project was build using only CSS and JavaScript, without any additional dependencies. Ideally would be to minify both CSS and JS in production, for now I leave them unminified so the code will be readable.

1. CSS approach:
   * Used Flexbox for elements alignment.
   * Used CSS3 pseudo elements to implement 'remove icon' and handle unordered list bottom border.
   * Tested cross browser compatibility with all latest major browsers.

2. JS approach:
   * Used vanilla JavaScript.
   * Used functional programming approach.
   * Some ES6 syntax.
